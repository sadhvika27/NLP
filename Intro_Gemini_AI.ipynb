            "* **Clarity and Readability:**  The code is formatted for better readability with comments explaining each function and its purpose.  Variable names are descriptive (e.g., `my_list`, `sorted_numbers`).\n",
            "* **`sorted()` vs. `list.sort()`:**  The code demonstrates both `sorted()` and `list.sort()`.  Crucially, it explains the difference:\n",
            "    * `sorted(my_list)`:  Returns a *new* sorted list, leaving the original list unchanged. This is generally preferred because it avoids unintended side effects.\n",
            "    * `my_list.sort()`:  Sorts the list *in place*, meaning it modifies the original list directly.  This is often more memory-efficient if you don't need the original list. The `sort()` method returns `None`.\n",
            "* **Descending Order:** Includes examples for sorting in descending order using `reverse=True`.  Shows how to do it with both `sorted()` and `list.sort()`.\n",
            "* **In-Place vs. Not In-Place:** The code makes it very clear when the original list is modified and when a new list is created.  This is essential for understanding how your code will behave.\n",
            "* **Docstrings:** Uses docstrings (`\"\"\"...\"\"\"`) to explain what each function does, its arguments, and its return value.  This is good practice for writing maintainable code.\n",
            "* **Example Usage:**  Provides clear examples of how to use each function, showing the input and output.  This makes it easy to understand and test the code.\n",
            "* **Returns None for `list.sort()`:** Explicitly states that `list.sort()` returns `None` because it modifies the list in-place. This is important to avoid common errors.\n",
            "* **Error Handling (Optional):**  While not included in this example to keep it concise, you could add error handling (e.g., `try...except`) to handle cases where the input is not a list or contains elements that cannot be compared (e.g., trying to sort a list containing both numbers and strings).  This is especially important if you're taking input from users or external sources.\n",
            "* **Efficiency:** Both `sorted()` and `list.sort()` use Timsort, which is a very efficient sorting algorithm (a hybrid of merge sort and insertion sort) that's well-suited for many real-world datasets.\n",
